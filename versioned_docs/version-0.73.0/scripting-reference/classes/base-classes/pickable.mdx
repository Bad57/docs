# Base Pickable

Base class for all Pickable entities

import * as AuthorityType from '/docs/components/_authority-components.mdx';
import * as BasicType from '/docs/components/_common-types.mdx';
import * as StructType from '/docs/components/_struct-types.mdx';

**Pickable** are special entities which can be **grabbed**, **hold** and **used** by [Characters](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/character). Example of Pickable entities are: [Weapons](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/weapon), [Items](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/item) and [Grenade](/docs/scripting-reference/classes/grenade).

They have special methods and events and are highlighted when looking at by a Character.
