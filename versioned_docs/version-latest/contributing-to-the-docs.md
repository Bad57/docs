Hello Dyno! Hello Markdown!

![](/img/docs/docusaurus.svg)

This docs is made on [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io) platform and written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)! Please feel free to suggest changes and edit the pages on GitHub, this help is really important to us and we really appreciate those who help writing it!


## Suggesting Changes

You can suggest changes directly on GitHub by pressing `Edit this Page` button at the bottom left of each Page, just make a suggestion and open a [**Pull Request**](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with it! Once accepted, your suggestion will immediately apply on the bleeding-edge version of the docs!


### API Reference

Our Docs is smart! The Scripting Reference section is auto generated based in our JSON [API Repository](https://github.com/nanos-world/api) on GitHub. We have defined all Classes, methods and events as JSON which can be parsed to any format!

So if you want to suggest a change to any description or typo you found there, refer to our API Repository folders: [Classes](https://github.com/nanos-world/api/tree/main/Classes), [StaticClasses](https://github.com/nanos-world/api/tree/main/StaticClasses), [Structs](https://github.com/nanos-world/api/tree/main/Structs), [UtilityClasses](https://github.com/nanos-world/api/tree/main/UtilityClasses), [StandardLibraries](https://github.com/nanos-world/api/tree/main/StandardLibraries) or [Enums](https://github.com/nanos-world/api/tree/main/Enums.json)!


### Translated Pages

By default, all pages on GitHub are in English and all translation is provided by Crowdin. You can access the [nanos world official docs Crowdin page](https://crowdin.com/project/nanos-world-docs) and help us fulfilling the translation for all available languages! More languages can be requested! Please let us know if you want to help with a new language!
