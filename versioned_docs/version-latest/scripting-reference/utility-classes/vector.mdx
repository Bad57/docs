:::

| **Returns** | **Name** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <BasicType.Boolean />`** | Check against another vector for equality, within specified error limits |
| <BasicType.Number />`** | Squared distance between two points. |
| <BasicType.Number />`** |  |
| <Structs.Vector /> | **`GetSafeNormal()`** | Gets a normalized copy of the vector, checking it is safe to do so based on the length |
| <BasicType.Boolean />`** | Checks whether vector is near to zero within a specified tolerance |
| <BasicType.Boolean />`** | Checks whether all components of the vector are exactly zero |
|  | **`Normalize()`** | Normalize this vector in-place if it is larger than a given tolerance. Leaves it unchanged if not |
| <BasicType.Number />`** | Get the squared length of this vector |
| <Structs.Rotator /> | **`Rotation()`** | Returns the orientation corresponding to the direction in which the vector points |
| <BasicType.Number /> of this vector |
