:::info

Vectors are internally and automatically compressed, which reduces it's size in the network up to 90%. Some cool details:
* Vectors parameters in Classes Methods are usually compressed with precision of 1 decimal place (with some exceptions which we need more precision).
* Vectors passed in Remote Events are compressed with precision of 2 decimal places. If you need more precision, we recommend passing them as raw number instead.
