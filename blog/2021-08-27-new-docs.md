Some time ago, we released our brand new docs version written in Markdown! It was using GitBook services and hosting, the jump was big from the previous version written in Sphinx.

Since then we are exploring the market possibilities, we've tested ReadMe, ReType and MdBook as well.

And then finally we've found Docusaurus! A open source Docs which allows a lot of customization, and even has some amazing built-in features that we can use! This is a next jump towards the success!

Check out the Key Features added in the full post!

### Better Search

Docusaurus provides tons of Search Engines to use, we are going to iterate between all of them to find the best one!

### Versioning

Now our docs can have versions! In advance to some plans we have in mind, we will be able to display different versions to be read!

### Multi-language

We are going to have Multi-language support! We still need to configure it but it is a must!

### Blog Page!

You must be already reading it, but now we can have a built-in Blog page! News everywhere everytime!

### 100% of customization

We can embed the power of React into Markdown, allowing we to modularize and automatize some page creations! Less effort to us! Also we can create our own Components Improving a lot the UX! 


Stay tuned because next weeks we are going to make HUGE announcements!
