# Classes Guide

All entities in nanos world are represented by a Class. In Lua, classes are represented by [tables](../../scripting-reference/glossary/basic-types.md#table). That means that every interaction with entities \(Players, Characters, [Props](../../scripting-reference/classes/prop.md), etc\) are made with Classes/tables methods following an [OOP \(Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) pattern\). In this page we will explain more about that.

{% hint style="success" %}
In nanos world we have 3 types of Classes \(or Structures\): [Classes](../../scripting-reference/classes/), [Static Classes](../../scripting-reference/static-classes/) and [Utility Classes](../../scripting-reference/utility-classes/).
{% endhint %}

## Classes

If you read our [Quick Start](../../getting-started/quick-start.md) guide, you noticed we were spawning entities in the following format:

```lua
-- Spawning an entity with a Constructor
local my_entity = Entity()

-- Interacting with the entity with it's methods
my_entity:MyFunction()
```

{% hint style="success" %}
Access to **Entities / Spawned Objects** **Methods** are made with **`:`**.
{% endhint %}

This is how **OOP** works! You create objects and call functions/catch events on that object. Unlike other scripting games which have tons of global functions and events to interact with entities, nanos world scripting is a **modern approach** to **modern programming**.

### Classes Inheritance

Under the hood, nanos world Classes follow an [Inheritance Pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_%28object-oriented_programming%29), which means we have base parent classes, and itâ€™s childs which inherits all functions, events and properties from them. You will notice that all Classes that can be spawned in the world are [Actors](../../scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor.md), for example in Character and [Prop](../../scripting-reference/classes/prop.md) \(which are Actors\) it is possible to call the function: `:SetLocation(Vector)`.

{% hint style="info" %}
The [Base Class Actor](../../scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/actor.md) is a very important class in nanos world. It contains the most of methods which are shared through all Classes we have, and also **Static Methods** to get and retrieve entities directly.
{% endhint %}

{% page-ref page="../../scripting-reference/classes/base-classes/" %}

### Spawning Entities

Spawning entities in nanos world is extremely easy and straightforward, let's say we want to spawn a Character:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Lua" %}
{% code title="Server/Index.lua" %}
```lua
local my_character = Character()
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Each Class will contain it's own **Constructor**, **Properties**, **Methods** and **Events**.

Check all Classes that nanos world provides in [Classes](../../scripting-reference/classes/).
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Keep in mind that some Classes can only be spawned in the **Server**, others can only be spawned in the **Client**.
{% endhint %}

### Destroying Entities

All classes \(but Player\) allow you to destroy them with the method `Destroy()`:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Lua" %}
{% code title="Server/Index.lua" %}
```lua
my_character:Destroy()
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Destroying an Entity will trigger the event `Destroy` and also will automatically detach all attached entities it had attached.
{% endhint %}

## Static Classes

Static Classes in nanos world are Classes which you cannot Spawn. Instead you can use it's methods directly with `.`.

For example, if you want to interact with World \(move the sun, set it raining, etc\), you will need the `World` Static Class:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Lua" %}
{% code title="Client/Index.lua" %}
```lua
-- Makes it 9:25 AM
World.SetTime(9, 25)
```
{% endcode %}
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="success" %}
Access to **Static Classes / Static Methods** are made with **`.`**.
{% endhint %}

{% page-ref page="../../scripting-reference/static-classes/" %}

## Utility Classes

Besides Classes and Static Classes, we have the **Utility Classes**! Those are mostly structs used in nanos world API such as Vector, Rotator, Color, JSON and some others.

{% hint style="success" %}
All Utility Classes are Open Sourced at [https://github.com/nanos-world/nanos-world-lua-lib](https://github.com/nanos-world/nanos-world-lua-lib). Feel free to push merge requests and suggest changes!
