All breaking changes in version 1.29.

To use the following new features, you must update your Package to Compatibility Mode version `1.29` or bigger.


## HTTP

Before `HTTP.Select` was an async method, and since 1.29 it works as a Sync method, not having the callback parameter anymore.


## Database

Before `Database:Execute` was an async method, and since 1.29 it works as a Sync method, not having the callback parameter anymore.
