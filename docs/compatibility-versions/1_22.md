All breaking changes in version 1.22.

In version 1.22 we introduced the concept of [Compatibility Version](/docs/next/core-concepts/packages/packages-guide#compatibility-version). Besides that, we've got just one breaking change:


## Events.Subscribe

`Events.Subscribe` now only subscribes to local events (ones called as **Events.Call**). If you want to subscribe to remote events (ones called as **Events.CallRemote** or **Events.BroadcastRemote**), please use `Events.SubscribeRemote`.

In compatibility mode (i.e. setting it to `1.21` or below) `Events.Subscribe` still subscribes for both Local and Remote events.
