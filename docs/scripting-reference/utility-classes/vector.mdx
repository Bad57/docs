:::tip

**Note:** This structure supports `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `^`, `==`, and `tostring` operations.

:::

| **Returns** | **Name** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| <BasicType.Boolean /> | **`Equals(other, tolerance)`** | Check against another vector for equality, within specified error limits |
| <BasicType.Number /> | **`Distance(other)`** | Distance between two points |
| <BasicType.Number /> | **`DistanceSquared(other)`** | Squared distance between two points |
| <Structs.Vector /> | **`GetUnsafeNormal()`** | Calculates normalized version of vector without checking for zero length |
| <Structs.Vector /> | **`GetSafeNormal()`** | Gets a normalized copy of the vector, checking it is safe to do so based on the length |
| <BasicType.Boolean /> | **`IsNearlyZero(tolerance)`** | Checks whether vector is near to zero within a specified tolerance |
| <BasicType.Boolean /> | **`IsZero()`** | Checks whether all components of the vector are exactly zero |
| <BasicType.Boolean /> | **`Normalize()`** | Normalize this vector in-place if it is larger than a given tolerance. Leaves it unchanged if not |
| <BasicType.Number /> | **`Size()`** | Get the length (magnitude) of this vector |
| <BasicType.Number /> | **`SizeSquared()`** | Get the squared length of this vector |
| <Structs.Rotator /> | **`Rotation()`** | Returns the orientation corresponding to the direction in which the vector points |
