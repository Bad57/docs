| **Returns** | **Name** | **Description** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| [boolean](../glossary/basic-types.md#boolean) | **`Equals(other, tolerance)`** | Check against another vector for equality, within specified error limits |
| [number](../glossary/basic-types.md#number) | **`DistanceSquared(vector)`** | Squared distance between two points. |
| [number](../glossary/basic-types.md#number) | **`Distance(vector)`** |  |
| [Vector](vector.md) | **`GetSafeNormal()`** | Gets a normalized copy of the vector, checking it is safe to do so based on the length |
| [boolean](../glossary/basic-types.md#boolean) | **`IsNearlyZero(tolerance)`** | Checks whether vector is near to zero within a specified tolerance |
| [boolean](../glossary/basic-types.md#boolean) | **`IsZero()`** | Checks whether all components of the vector are exactly zero |
|  | **`Normalize()`** | Normalize this vector in-place if it is larger than a given tolerance. Leaves it unchanged if not |
| [number](../glossary/basic-types.md#number) | **`SizeSquared()`** | Get the squared length of this vector |
| [Rotator](rotator.md) | **`Rotation()`** | Returns the orientation corresponding to the direction in which the vector points |
| [number](../glossary/basic-types.md#number) | **`Size()`** | Get the length \(magnitude\) of this vector |
